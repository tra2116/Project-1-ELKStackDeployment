Dealer involved: Billy Jones

Player invovled: Mylie Schmidt

Specific Reasons: Lucky Duck suffered loss 5 times on 0310, 5 times on 0312, and 3 times on 0315. Mylie Schmidt is the only player that was
playing during each of those times. Correlating the time of losses on those specific dates with Dealer Schedule files, I was able to establish 
that Billy Jones was the only roulette dealer involved.
